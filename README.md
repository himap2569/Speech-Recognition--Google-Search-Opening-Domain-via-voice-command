# Speech-Recognition--Google-Search-Opening-Domain-via-voice-command
The applications allow the user to google search and open a domain through a voice command when the program is made to run.
These applications are developed using Python 3.3+ and SpeechRecognition is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+, but requires some additional installation steps for Python 2.
For this project, we have used python 3.3+, folllowed by SpeechRecognition package from which Recognizer class is used to easily recognize speech from both a file—using record()—and microphone input—using listen().
Segments of an audio file are processed using the offset and duration keyword arguments of the record() method.
